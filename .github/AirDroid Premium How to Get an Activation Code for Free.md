However, this is not a safe or legal way to use the app. In this article, we will explain why you should avoid using cracked activation codes and how you can get AirDroid Premium for free legally.
 
## Why You Should Avoid Using Cracked Activation Codes
 
Some websites claim to offer free activation codes for AirDroid Premium, but these are usually fake or malicious. Here are some reasons why you should avoid using them:
 
- They may not work. Most of the activation codes you find online are either expired, invalid, or already used by someone else. You will waste your time and effort trying to activate them.
- They may harm your device. Some of the activation codes may contain viruses, malware, or spyware that can infect your device and compromise your security and privacy. You may lose your data, expose your personal information, or damage your device.
- They may violate the terms of service. Using cracked activation codes is against the terms of service of AirDroid and may result in your account being suspended or banned. You may also face legal consequences for violating the intellectual property rights of the developers.

## How to Get AirDroid Premium for Free Legally
 
The good news is that there are some legitimate ways to get AirDroid Premium for free or at a discounted price. Here are some of them:

- Use the free trial. AirDroid offers a 7-day free trial for new users who sign up with an email address. You can enjoy all the premium features during this period without any limitations or charges. You can cancel anytime before the trial ends if you don't want to continue.
- Use a coupon code. AirDroid occasionally offers coupon codes that can give you a discount on the premium subscription. You can find these codes on their official website, social media pages, newsletters, or partner sites. You can apply the coupon code when you check out and pay less for the premium plan.
- Use a referral program. AirDroid has a referral program that allows you to earn free premium days by inviting your friends to use the app. You can get one free premium day for each friend who signs up with your referral link and activates their account. You can invite up to 100 friends and get up to 100 free premium days.

## Conclusion
 
AirDroid is a useful app that lets you access and manage your Android device from your computer or web browser. However, some features require a premium subscription, which costs money. If you want to get AirDroid Premium for free, you should avoid using cracked activation codes that are unsafe and illegal. Instead, you should use the free trial, coupon codes, or referral program that are offered by AirDroid legally.
